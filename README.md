# CohortConnect

<b>A digital bulletin board for students in the same coding class based on real-time GitHub API data</b>

This application was created to allow students in our cohort to view each others github activity. It allows users to also have "Statuses" kind of like writing on a blackboard. This project was made for our mod 4 project in order to further our understanding of React. Implements React-Router and Semantic-UI.

- [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)

## Features

- Allows students in the same coding class to view basic Github information of other students.

FrontEnd requires Git and Node Package Manager

In Terminal/Console:

```
 # Clone the repos into the same folder
 $ git clone git@github.com:KSriki/CohortConnectFrontEnd.git
 $ git clone git@github.com:KSriki/CohortConnectBackend.git
 

 # navigate to backend
 $ cd CohortConnectBackend
 
 # setup backend
 $ bundle install
 
 # create the database
 $ rails db:create
 
 # migrate the database (add tables etc.)
 $ rails db:migrate
